## About The Project


  Nowadays, as the cinematographic industry is developing fast, it gets harder to keep
track of all the worthy movies. According to a survey, taken in February of 2018, 19% of US
citizens watch or stream a movie daily, and 26% claim to watch several movies every week
(Stoll, 2021). There is a multitude of applications that offer the possibility of watching all the
upcoming products, such as: “YouTube”, “Netflix”, “HBO”, and so on. However, not that
many people want to venture into discovering a movie by directly watching it -- many prefer
reading a short description, consulting some reviews, or choosing by their popularity.

  MyFlixer website is a less known platform for streaming movies. It is loved by its few
users because of the absence of ads and a large variety of movies. However,
the owner of the website, Felix Myer, wants to make his customers’ experience better.
What he thinks about is making an application that briefly presents the information about
the movies from the website. The new subsidiary of MyFlixer, called MyFlixerJr, has been
tasked to deal with the mentioned problem.

  It takes too much time coming home from work and watching trailer after trailer,
hoping that the perfect movie for the evening might pop up. Reading a good description,
containing the catchy parts (but no spoilers) is the best option for a movie lover.

  Besides, seeing the rating or the comments given by the audience can have an
impact in whether a movie shall be watched or not. Even though this kind of applications do
not offer a direct way of watching the movie, they are most suitable for conveying the
necessary information.

  Just like a news app, that briefly introduces the reader to the most recent events
around the world, it is convenient to always have an insight into the wide range of movie
genres, public preferences, outstanding directors, and famous actors. The public demand to
stay in touch with the updates or current trends never sinks. Knowledge is power, as they
say.

  On the other hand, the audience demands outmost clarity and precision. The ratings
that are shown have to be as close to the actual popularity of movies as possible. The
reviews must also be both concise and appealing, not to mention that the lists of genres
must be well-defined. The tasks brought by these responsibilities could be separated
between more people.

  As it is harder to keep track of all the upcoming movies and be able to choose
something from them, the company MyFlixer needs to make the navigation process easier
for its users.
Following this section is the Analysis, in which the problem domain and the expected
result of the project are elaborated.
